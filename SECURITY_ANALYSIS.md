# Arithmetic Security Analysis - Credence Bond Contract

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive security analysis of arithmetic operations in the Credence Bond smart contract, focusing on overflow and underflow protection.

**Analysis Date:** February 22, 2026  
**Contract Version:** 0.1.0  
**Test Coverage:** 28 security tests implemented

## Executive Summary

✅ **All security tests passing**  
✅ **Safe math operations verified**  
✅ **Boundary conditions tested**  
✅ **No critical arithmetic vulnerabilities detected**

## Test Coverage Summary

### 1. i128 Overflow Tests (7 tests)

Tests verify safe handling of bond amounts using i128 integers:

- **test_i128_bond_amount_at_max**: ✅ Verifies bonds can be created with i128::MAX value
- **test_i128_overflow_on_top_up**: ✅ Ensures top-ups panic on overflow
- **test_i128_overflow_on_max_top_up**: ✅ Tests overflow when topping up from MAX value
- **test_i128_overflow_on_massive_slashing**: ✅ Verifies slashing overflows are caught
- **test_i128_large_bond_operations**: ✅ Tests operations with very large values
- **test_negative_bond_amount_handling**: ✅ Documents behavior with negative amounts
- **test_withdrawal_with_max_i128_bond**: ✅ Verifies withdrawals from maximum bonds

**Findings:**

- All i128 arithmetic operations use `checked_add()` and `checked_sub()`
- Overflow/underflow conditions properly panic with descriptive messages
- Maximum value bonds (i128::MAX) are handled correctly
- Negative values are technically allowed (may need business logic validation)

### 2. u64 Timestamp Overflow Tests (5 tests)

Tests verify safe handling of timestamps and durations:

- **test_u64_max_duration**: ✅ Bonds can be created with max duration (u64::MAX)
- **test_u64_overflow_on_duration_extension**: ✅ Duration extensions panic on overflow
- **test_u64_overflow_on_end_timestamp**: ✅ Bond creation checks end timestamp overflow
- **test_u64_large_duration_extension**: ✅ Large extensions work within limits
- **test_timestamp_boundary_conditions**: ✅ Near-max timestamps handled safely

**Findings:**

- Bond creation validates that `bond_start + bond_duration` doesn't overflow
- Duration extension operations use `checked_add()`
- Timestamps near u64::MAX are handled properly
- No risk of timestamp wraparound vulnerabilities

### 3. Withdrawal Underflow Tests (8 tests)

Tests verify safe withdrawal operations:

- **test_withdrawal_exceeds_available_balance**: ✅ Panics when withdrawing more than available
- **test_withdrawal_after_slashing**: ✅ Correctly accounts for slashed amounts
- **test_withdrawal_exact_available_balance**: ✅ Can withdraw exact available balance
- **test_withdrawal_zero_amount**: ✅ Zero withdrawals are safe
- **test_multiple_withdrawals_causing_underflow**: ✅ Multiple withdrawals checked properly
- **test_withdrawal_with_max_i128_bond**: ✅ Large withdrawals work correctly
- **test_withdrawal_when_fully_slashed**: ✅ Prevents withdrawal when fully slashed
- **test_withdrawal_leaves_insufficient_for_slashed**: ✅ Validates available balance

**Findings:**

- Withdrawal logic correctly calculates available balance: `bonded - slashed`
- All withdrawal operations use `checked_sub()` for underflow protection
- Insufficient balance conditions panic with clear error messages
- Slashed amounts are properly considered in availability calculations

### 4. Slashing Underflow Tests (6 tests)

Tests verify safe slashing operations:

- **test_slashing_normal_amount**: ✅ Normal slashing increments correctly
- **test_slashing_exceeds_bonded_amount**: ✅ Slashing is capped at bonded amount
- **test_multiple_slashing_operations**: ✅ Multiple slashes accumulate correctly
- **test_slashing_zero_amount**: ✅ Zero slashing is handled safely
- **test_slashing_after_withdrawal**: ✅ Slashing works after withdrawals
- **test_slashing_with_max_values**: ✅ Large slash amounts handled properly

**Findings:**

- Slashing uses `checked_add()` to prevent overflow
- Slashed amounts are automatically capped at bonded amounts
- Multiple slashing operations accumulate safely
- Edge case: slashed_amount can't exceed bonded_amount invariant is maintained

### 5. Combined Scenario Tests (2 tests)

Tests verify complex multi-operation scenarios:

- **test_complex_arithmetic_scenario**: ✅ Verifies bond creation → top-up → slash → withdraw
- **test_boundary_arithmetic_with_zero_values**: ✅ Operations on zero-value bonds

**Findings:**

- Complex operation sequences maintain arithmetic safety
- State transitions preserve invariants
- Zero-value operations don't cause panics

## Security Vulnerabilities Found

### Critical: 0

No critical arithmetic vulnerabilities detected.

### High: 0

No high-severity issues found.

### Medium: 0

No medium-severity issues found.

### Low: 1

**L-01: Negative Bond Amounts**

- **Description:** The contract allows creation of bonds with negative i128 values
- **Impact:** While technically safe from overflow/underflow, negative bonds may violate business logic
- **Recommendation:** Add validation to reject negative bond amounts if they're not intended
- **Test:** `test_negative_bond_amount_handling` documents this behavior

## Safe Math Implementation

All arithmetic operations in the contract use Rust's checked arithmetic:

```rust
// Examples from the contract

// Addition with overflow check
bond.bonded_amount.checked_add(amount)
    .expect("top-up caused overflow");

// Subtraction with underflow check
bond.bonded_amount.checked_sub(amount)
    .expect("withdrawal caused underflow");

// Timestamp addition check
bond_start.checked_add(duration)
    .expect("bond end timestamp would overflow");
```

### Panic Messages

All arithmetic operations include descriptive panic messages:

- `"top-up caused overflow"`
- `"withdrawal caused underflow"`
- `"slashing caused overflow"`
- `"duration extension caused overflow"`
- `"bond end timestamp would overflow"`
- `"insufficient balance for withdrawal"`
- `"slashed amount exceeds bonded amount"`
